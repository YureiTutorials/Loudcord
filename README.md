# Loudcord

Hey, this is the Loudcord the loudmic com was paying, for about 150 usd, I just decided to release it because I am simply quiting this toxic community, enjoy, you got the sourcecode, for a Tutorial on how to build it, just follow the installations steps.

# What is Loudcord ?

Loudcord is a fork of Abaddon Discord client, but made for loudmicing, it has increased volume etc ... You are free to edit it to add your own things like discord exploits or sum. I just made it louder.


# Installation

1) extract Loudcord and the EXTRACT THIS.rar because it was too big for Github apparently so I had to pack it.

2) install https://www.msys2.org
   
3) go into MSYS2 folders, and install the thing bellowand look for " mingw64 " when you did that, just replace the mingw64 file with this one because it contain a custom audio encoder ( edited OPUS )

4) when you did that, launch MSYS2 MINGW64 and not another one ! and does these commands : CD to the destination, for example, for me its : " d:/d/loudcord/build " but for you it's different.

5) now, just use these commands :
 
# cmake -GNinja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
# ninja

5) Don't delete the 3 files already in the BUILD file, because they are necessary to make it work.
  
6) Now you can launch it using " start abaddon.exe " and you can ONLY launch it by doing that !

# How to use it and be really loud ?

Simple, when you launched it, click " Discord " and " set token " , then click " CONNECT ", when you did that, join a voice chat, put the volume like you want, its basicly the " gain bar " of Ripcord but with volume.
When you are in a VC, click " View " and " More settings " at the top left of the volume bar, and set the bitrate to 500 000 not more otherwise it will crash.

# How loud is it ?

Well it's Ripcord, with Region bypass, mute, and deafen buttons lol. You can now pack and its undetectable. ( If you try it against ripcord, go a lil low and u will basicly destroy ripcord cuz Loudcord have discord clearness.

# Made by YUREI, you can fully skid it if you want , edit the code as you want, I don't have a license and I will never.
